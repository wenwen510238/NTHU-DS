# Data Science HW4

# you must use python 3.10
# For linux, you must use HomeworkFramework.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
# For Mac, you must use HomeworkFramework.cpython-310-darwin.so
# If both can not work, you can use colab and download HomeworkFramework.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so. Don't forget to modify output's name.
